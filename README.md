# FacialRecognition
Facial classifier to determine if a human face is real or is a picture. 

It uses a HAAR cascade clasifier file as well as the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to detect and describe local features of an image.

If a homography matrix can be found for 1 image from 2 different angles, it's determined to be real.
